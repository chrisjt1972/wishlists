// Speleologist (first-choice PvE)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Steady Rounds, Extended Magazine), Enlightened Action, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing minor enemies in end-game content, particularly with solar builds. Speleologist's stats are on the low side, unfortunately, but there are still some very usable rolls. At base, 28 Range equates to 46.60m while ADS, 49 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.40s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 61 is a 4.59s reload. Total ammo is 514 total out of the box - which is pretty much the ceiling - increasing to 583/652/687 with 1/2/3 reserve mods. On controller, you're going to find the recoil difficult - Arrowhead Brake is the obvious choice as the barrel perk to straighten recoil direction, and the additional Handling is useful on M+KB too. Controllers might even benefit from Steady Rounds as the magazine perk too, but if you can keep to short, controlled bursts (like Cpl Hicks advises) then use Extended Magazine to increase mag size. As your trait perk combination, Enlightened Action helps with both Handling and Reload Speed and Incandescent mows down add mobs with ease, particularly when building into solar scorch and ignition verbs. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love? If you're interested, a Speleologist is someone involved in the scientific study or exploration of caves. Recommended MW: Stability (Controller) or Handling (M+KB), with a Quick Access Sling mod.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller
